## About Me

I am a doctoral student in information science at the [iSchool](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
My research focuses on algorithmic justice, integrating social and technical approaches to issues of equity in computing.
I am broadly interested in AI ethics, how we incorporate social identity into predictive systems, and the epistemological assumptions of computing.
PDFs of my work can be found on my [Research](/research.md) page.

I am primarily advised by [Dr. Nigel Bosch](https://pnigel.com) and am a member of his [Human + Machine Learning Lab](https://humanplusml.com/).
I am also affiliated with Dr. Jana Diesner's [Social Computing Lab](http://jdiesnerlab.ischool.illinois.edu/)
and Dr. Anita Chan's [Community Data Clinic](https://communitydata.illinois.edu/).

In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, reading speculative fiction, baking, community organizing, and spending time outside.
I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Bowdoin College in 2017. Before starting my PhD, I
worked at a startup in Boston, first as a technical writer and then as a DevOps Engineer.
